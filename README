ECE 428
MP 1 : Distributed GREP
Elzabad Kennedy & John Kernagis

Compilation Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Clean and Compile.
---> make clean
---> make

2. Run the program on each computer.
---> ./<name>

3. Upon running each instance of the program, you will be asked to enter
    the addresses of the other machines, as well as the machine ID of the
    current instance.  Please give each machine a unique ID from 1 to 4.

4. You can run a unit test by entering the "/test" command from any machine.

    This will send a command to the other machines to generate logs based on
    their machine ID.  The current machine will then send grep requests to the
    other machines.  When the results are received, the current machine compares
    the results to an internally defined answer file and reports success or failure.

5. Otherwise, you can use the grep command to perform a distributed search of log
    files stored on all the machines.  Log files should be named based on machine ID:
        machine.1.log
        machine.2.log
        machine.3.log
        machine.4.log

    See COMMAND USAGE below for an explanation of the available flags.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
COMMAND USAGE

You may do a grep on either the entire log file, line by line as is grep's default,
  or limit the grep to either the keys or values.  This is accomplished internally
  via the gawk command.

From the client, just enter a grep command with your requested pattern to do a
  distributed grep on the log files as a whole.

---> grep YOUR_SEARCH_TERM_HERE

Internally we do:
    system("gawk -F: '$0~/YOUR_SEARCH_TERM_HERE/{print$0}' machine.THIS_MACHINE.log > result.tmp");

If you wish to only grep the keys, then add the -k flag to your command:

---> grep -k YOUR_SEARCH_TERM_HERE

Internally we do:
    system("gawk -F: '$1~/YOUR_SEARCH_TERM_HERE/{print$0}' machine.THIS_MACHINE.log > result.tmp");

If you wish to only grep the values, then add the -v flag to your command:

---> grep -v YOUR_SEARCH_TERM_HERE

Internally we do:
    system("gawk -F: '$2~/YOUR_SEARCH_TERM_HERE/{print$0}' machine.THIS_MACHINE.log > result.tmp");

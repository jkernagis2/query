Set the address the address server is going to be running on.
This value needs to be defined in <some header file>.
Set the machine ID's, these values are defined in <some head file>.
Compile everything.
---> make clean
---> make all

Run the address keeping server on one computer.
---> ./server

Run the clients on each computer.
---> ./client

You can run a unit test by entering the "/test" command from the server.
This will send a command to the clients to generate logs based on their machine ID.
The server will then send a grep request to the clients.  When the results are received,
the server compares the results to an internally defined answer string and reports success or failure.

COMMAND USAGE

You may do a grep on either the entire log file, line by line as is grep's default, or limit the grep to either the keys or values.
This is accomplished internally via the gawk command.

From the client, just enter a grep command with your requested patter to do a distributed grep on the log files as a whole.

---> grep REGEXP

Internally we do: system("gawk -F: '$0~/STUFF/{print$0}' machine.THIS_MACHINE.log > result.tmp");

If you wish to only grep the keys, then add the -k flag to your command:

---> grep -k REGEXP

Internally we do: system("gawk -F: '$1~/STUFF/{print$0}' machine.THIS_MACHINE.log > result.tmp");

If you wish to only grep the values, then add the -v flag to your command:

grep -v REGEXP

Internally we do: system("gawk -F: '$2~/STUFF/{print$0}' machine.THIS_MACHINE.log > result.tmp");

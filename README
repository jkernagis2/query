Compilation Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Clean and Compile.
---> make clean
---> make

2. Run the program on each computer.
---> ./release

3. Upon running each instance of the program, you will be asked to enter
    the address of the other master machine, as well as the machine ID of the
    current instance.  Please give each machine a unique integer ID.

4. Basic commands:
---> /join
Joins the group by sending a message to the master contact specified above.

---> /leave
Cleanly leaves the group by sending a leave gossip to log2(N) machines.

---> /quit
Closes the program.  Does not cleanly leave the group beforehand.

---> grep
You can use the grep command to perform a distributed search of log
  files stored on all the machines.  Log files will be named based on machine ID:
    machine.1.log
    machine.2.log
    machine.3.log
    machine.4.log

See COMMAND USAGE below for an explanation of the available flags for our grep.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
COMMAND USAGE

You may do a grep on either the entire log file, line by line as is grep's default,
  or limit the grep to either the keys or values.  This is accomplished internally
  via the gawk command.

From the client, just enter a grep command with your requested pattern to do a
  distributed grep on the log files as a whole.

---> grep YOUR_SEARCH_TERM_HERE

Internally we do:
    system("gawk -F: '$0~/YOUR_SEARCH_TERM_HERE/{print$0}' machine.THIS_MACHINE.log > result.tmp");

If you wish to only grep the keys, then add the -k flag to your command:

---> grep -k YOUR_SEARCH_TERM_HERE

Internally we do:
    system("gawk -F: '$1~/YOUR_SEARCH_TERM_HERE/{print$0}' machine.THIS_MACHINE.log > result.tmp");

If you wish to only grep the values, then add the -v flag to your command:

---> grep -v YOUR_SEARCH_TERM_HERE

Internally we do:
    system("gawk -F: '$2~/YOUR_SEARCH_TERM_HERE/{print$0}' machine.THIS_MACHINE.log > result.tmp");
